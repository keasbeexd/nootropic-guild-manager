# Nootropic Guild Manager

Your whole guild in one window, for **World of Warcraft: Forever**. Profiles,
crafters, raid readiness, who to play with tonight, a guild census, a Hall
of Fame and friendly recruiting, shared between everyone in the guild who runs it.

Nootropic Guild Manager works on top of the game's own Guild & Communities
window rather than replacing it, and adds a window of its own for what the
game can't do. Every copy of the addon shares what its player knows
(their spec, professions, recipes, attunements, when they usually play), so
the more of your guild runs it, the more it knows. It was made for the
**<Nootropic>** guild and is free for any guild to use.

## Features

- **Find** — search the whole guild by name, class, spec, profession,
  Discord or notes; group every main with their alts; sort and filter.
- **Who Can Craft?** — every recipe your guildmates know, searchable, with
  online crafters first. Shared automatically when someone opens their
  profession window.
- **Play Together** — guildmates online near your level (your zone first),
  and who usually plays at this hour.
- **Overview** — how many of each class, level and profession, and a
  heatmap of when the guild plays.
- **Hall of Fame** — guild leaderboards from everyone's character
  statistics: quests, kills, dungeon bosses, deaths and more, all time or by
  month.
- **Profiles** — spec, roles, professions with skill levels, Discord and a
  contact note, usual play hours, raid readiness (Onyxia attunement, the
  Barrow Deeps key) and your own private notes.
- **On the game's guild roster** — alt markers, richer tooltips, and Profile
  and Main / Alt on the right-click menu.
- **Recruiting** — `/who` for players without a guild, whispers that read
  like you typed them, a guild-wide 14-day re-whisper lockout, a shared Do
  Not Whisper list, and an Invite prompt when someone says yes.
- **For officers** — an audit of every change, including joins, leaves,
  kicks, promotions and level-ups from the guild log; an officer log; join
  dates and "rank since" on every profile.
- **Guild Master permissions** — choose which ranks may edit their own
  profile, link alts, edit others' profiles and recruit.
- **Safe sync** — every copy checks who sent each change, so nobody can
  forge someone's profile or the Guild Master's settings. Your private notes
  never leave your computer.

Release history is in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md), how it works inside
is in [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md), and how releases are

## Install

Every release is published to all three, so use whichever you like:

- **[CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/nootropic-guild-manager)**: the CurseForge app, or search "Nootropic Guild Manager" in WowUp.
- **[Wago Addons](https://addons.wago.io/addons/nootropic-guild-manager)**: the Wago app, or WowUp.
- **GitHub, with WowUp:** Get Addons > **Install from URL**, paste `https://github.com/keasbeexd/nootropic-guild-manager`, with your WoW: Forever installation selected.

Whichever you pick, it offers each new release as an update.

**By hand:** download `NootropicGuildManager-vX.Y-forever.zip` from the [latest release](https://github.com/keasbeexd/nootropic-guild-manager/releases/latest), then:

1. Unzip so the folder sits at `Interface/AddOns/NootropicGuildManager` (the folder must be named exactly `NootropicGuildManager`).
   - Use the `Interface/AddOns` folder inside the `_classic..._` folder the Forever client installs into (the beta used `_classic_beta_`).
2. Restart the game or `/reload`, and make sure Nootropic Guild Manager is enabled on the character select AddOns screen.
3. If it shows as "out of date" after a patch, tick **Load out of date AddOns**, or update the `## Interface:` line in `NootropicGuildManager.toc` (`/dump select(4, GetBuildInfo())` prints your client's number).

## First launch

The first time you log in with the addon (and once after updating to 2.5.0), a short **welcome tour** opens: a page for each tab (Find, Play Together, Who Can Craft?, Profiles and Raids, and Recruitment or Audit if your rank uses them), then your **sharing choices**, your **profile basics** (Discord name, contact note and roles), a **permissions** page for the Guild Master, and where to find things later. Skip it any time; reopen it from **Options** or with `/ngm welcome`.

## Opening it

- `/ngm` (or `/nootropic`), the minimap button, the addon compartment menu, or the **shortcut tab on the Guild & Communities window**.
- Minimap button: left-click opens Find, right-click the Options, shift-click Recruitment (all changeable in Options). Clicking again closes the window.
- Drag the grip in the bottom-right corner to resize the window. The size is saved.

## What you see

**On the game's Guild & Communities roster** — Nootropic Guild Manager works on top of Blizzard's own guild roster rather than replacing it:

- **After each name**: "alt" for alts.
- **Hover a member**: Blizzard's tooltip gets this addon's details underneath: main or alts, spec, roles, professions with skill levels, Discord and when they usually play.
- **Right-click a member**: **Profile** and **Main / Alt** (mark as alt, change main, make main, unlink, add an alt; if your rank may) are added to Blizzard's menu.
- **Alt+click a member** (or **Profile** in the menu) opens their profile docked beside the window, next to Blizzard's own member details when those are open.
- Only shown on your guild, not other communities. **Options > Show alts and profiles on the Guild roster** turns all of it off. Nothing Blizzard does is changed or replaced, so inviting, promoting and removing keep working normally.

**Find tab** (in this addon's window) — for what the game's roster can't do: search by professions, spec, Discord and more (see **Searching**), group mains with their alts, and filter. It lists every guild member with first name (with class icon), second name, level, class, location, spec, Main / Alt ("Main" or "Alt of Markpri"), up to three professions with skill levels, guild rank, and the Addon Version of Nootropic Guild Manager they run (shown in red when someone in the guild has a newer version, "(missing)" if they don't use the addon, "(reminded)" once someone has reminded them). A blue "(missing)" is a button: one click sends the install reminder (hover it first to see the whisper). For anyone without the addon, **Remind to install the addon** on the right-click menu (and on their profile, and on the game's roster menu) sends them a one-click whisper saying why it's worth having and where to get it. Each person is reminded at most once per 30 days, shared across the whole guild so nobody is asked twice; the text is yours to change in the multi-line box under **Options > Install Reminder**. Discord names show with an @ (type them with or without one), and profiles with one get an **On Discord** badge. Every column but second name starts shown; right-click a column header to choose columns. Click a column header to sort; sorting by Main / Alt groups each main with their alts. Offline members are dimmed.

- **Right-click any column header** to show or hide columns. Your choice is saved between logins. Name can't be hidden.
- **Rearrange columns** by dragging a header left or right; a gold marker shows where it will land. The order is saved between logins. "Reset column order" in the Columns menu, or **List Columns** in Options (order, widths and shown columns), puts things back.
- **Resize a column** by dragging the right edge of its header. Widths are saved; "Reset column widths" in the Columns menu undoes it. The last column fills the leftover space.
- **Smaller windows** shrink columns toward a minimum width, then hide them in this order: Rank, Class, Lvl, Location, Professions, Main / Alt, Spec, Second Name. First Name is never hidden. Hidden columns come back when you widen the window, and the Columns menu marks them "(window too narrow)".
- The **Spec** column and the profile show each class's talent-tree icon.

- **Click a member** to open the detail panel beside the roster.
- **Right-click a member** for quick main/alt (if your rank may), whisper and invite.
- **The bar at the top:** search on the left, **Who Can Craft?** and **Filter** on the right. **Filter** has **Online only**, **Show** (mains and alts, mains only, alts only), **Class**, **Rank** and **Only guildmates using the addon**, plus **Reset filters**; your filter choices are saved. The button shows how many are on, e.g. "Filter (2)".
- **The summary line** under the bar shows members, how many are online and how many use the addon (and how many are showing when you search or filter). Active filters are listed on its right, with **Clear** to turn them all off.
- **"x using Nootropic Guild Manager"** at the bottom of the window (it says your guild's name instead when that option is on): click it to list only guildmates running the addon, with the Version column turned on. It turns on **Filter > Only guildmates using the addon**; click **Clear** on the summary line to see everyone again. Options can hide it.

**Character profile** — opens beside the roster when you click a member. It reads like a profile card, with an **Edit** button when you can change it.

- **Header**: name, "Level 22 Feral Druid - Veteran" (with the spec icon), online status and zone. Under it, one line for **main / alts** (click a name to open that profile).
- **Contact**: their **Discord** name (click it to copy) and a contact note (up to 80 characters: BattleTag, timezone, "DM me before raids"). Set by the member, or by anyone whose rank may edit other guildmates' profiles (handy for guildmates without the addon). Alts without their own show their main's. Searchable with `discord:`.
- **Usually online**: a one-line summary of when they usually play (e.g. "Mon-Fri 8 pm-11 pm - Sat-Sun 2 pm-12 am"). Times follow **your game clock**: if its **Use Local Time** box is ticked you see your local time, otherwise server time, and **24 Hour Mode** shows "20:00-23:00". **Show week** unfolds a week grid; hover a block to see it on the other clock too. Hours are **learned automatically**: while you play, your own copy of the addon notes the server hour every 10 minutes and keeps the last 4 weeks (an hour counts once you've played it in two different weeks), and only the result is shared. Don't want that? Untick **Learn when I usually play** in Options; nothing is noted or shared then. Everything is kept in server time, the same for the whole guild, so no time zone settings are needed.
- **Tabs**: **Profile** (professions: primary first, then secondary; the ones their addon reports stay up to date by themselves; **Recipes (N)** lists every recipe they've shared), **Raids** (raid readiness, see below), **Notes** (your **private notes** about them; only you ever see these), and **Officer** (officers only: the **officer log** and **change history**, headed by when they **joined** (and who invited them) and since when they've held their **current rank**; these two are kept even after the audit's history expires). Officers also see **Joined** and **Rank since** in the roster tooltip.
- **Edit** (your own characters, or others if your rank may): **Contact**, **specialization**, **roles**, **professions** (add, remove, set levels) and **main & alt links**. **Done** goes back.

**Who Can Craft?** (everyone) — every recipe your guildmates know, in one search. Type part of a recipe or item name ("flask", "bracers") and see who can make it, guildmates online now first (in green); hover a recipe for the full tooltip and every crafter, click it to open a crafter's profile. Open it from the Find tab's **Who Can Craft?** button or with `/ngm craft <name>`. Recipes are **shared automatically** when someone with the addon opens one of their own profession windows: the addon reads the recipes they've learned the same way the game's window lists them, and shares just the recipe numbers (every copy of the addon looks up the names). Recipes hidden by the window's own search or filters are kept from earlier visits, and a profession you drop is cleared. The game doesn't let addons read anyone else's recipes, so guildmates without the addon don't appear.

**Raid readiness** (the **Raids** tab on every profile) — what each character needs for the raids, worked out by their own addon from completed quests and the items in their bags:

- **Onyxia's Lair**: the **Onyxia attunement**: done when they've finished "Blood of the Black Dragon Champion" (Horde, quest 6602) or "Drakefire Amulet" (Alliance, quest 6502), or have the Drakefire Amulet in their bags or bank. The chain starts with Warlord Goretooth in Kargath (Horde) or Helendis Riverhorn at Morgan's Vigil (Alliance).
- **The Barrow Deeps**: no attunement; the **Brooch of the Wardens** opens the Vord'anaar Prison inside it. Found in their bags by name (English game clients), then remembered.
- **Hyjal Summit**: no attunement.

A green check means done, red means not yet, and a clock means unknown (they don't run the addon, or haven't logged in since updating). Quest and item numbers come from Wowhead's WoW Forever database.

**Play Together tab** (everyone) — who to play with right now. **Online now** lists guildmates online within a few levels of you (5 by default; 3, 10 or any level from the button at the top right), people in your zone first, with their level (and how far from yours), zone, spec and roles. **Usually on around now** lists guildmates who aren't online but usually play at this hour, from their shared usual hours (only guildmates running the addon with **Learn when I usually play** on share them). Your own characters are left out. Click anyone for their profile. `/ngm play` opens it.

**Overview tab** (everyone) — the guild at a glance. Bars for how many of each **class**, **level** band (1-9 up to 60) and **profession**, and **When we play**: a week heatmap (in your clock) of how many guildmates usually play in each two-hour block, from the hours they share. Hover a block to see who; click any bar to list those members on the Find tab. The button at the top right picks who's counted: members online in the last 7, 30 (default) or 90 days, or everyone. Each person counts once, as their main, and is active if any of their characters was; tick **Count alts** to count every character. `/ngm overview` opens it.

**Hall of Fame tab** (everyone) — guild leaderboards from the game's own character statistics (the Statistics page of the achievement window), which each member's addon reads and shares. A card per statistic shows the top five: **Most Champion Wins** (see below), **Social Butterfly** (hours spent in guild chat conversations: 15-minute blocks where you and at least one guildmate both spoke, at most 8 a day, so spamming gets nothing; only the time is shared, never the text), **quests completed**, **kills**, **dungeon & raid bosses** (final bosses, Forever's own included), **dungeons entered**, **honorable kills**, **battlegrounds won**, **duels won**, **epics looted**, **deaths**, **deaths from falling**, **flights taken**, **hearthstones used**, **fish caught** and **hugs given**, with guild totals on top. Hover a card for the top 15. **Champions:** each card's leader for a month is its champion, shown at the bottom of the card all through the next month ("Last month: ..."). Winner takes all, and a tie makes everyone at the top a champion. Every title counts toward **Most Champion Wins**; titles are written down by an officer's copy of the addon on the 2nd of each month, so nobody can award themselves one. A line near the top of the tab counts down to the next crowning (in your own time); on the 1st it says the points are being tallied. Champions carry their title all next month, in gold on their profile and in tooltips. Officers get an **Announce Champions** button at the top of the tab: one click posts the champions to guild chat (hover first for a preview and who announced last). When an officer inspects a guildmate, their copy also checks that guildmate's shared numbers against the game's own statistics comparison; officers see "match" or "don't match" in that person's tooltip. A person's main and alts always count as one. Each statistic has a generous ceiling (per day of play since WoW: Forever opened, and per month), so an edited copy of the addon can't claim impossible numbers: anyone breaking one is left out, and officers can **Hide from Hall of Fame** (right-click on Find) anyone whose numbers still look wrong. Pick **All time**, **This month** or **Last month** (UTC months; a member's first month counts from when they installed the addon). Gold is never shared. Only members running the addon with **Share my statistics** on are listed; a line under the totals says how many guildmates aren't on the board yet, with a button that lists them on Find. `/ngm hof` opens it.

**Recruitment tab**

1. The search bar reads **Name**, **Zone**, **Level**, **Filter**, **Search**. Click **Search** (it runs the game's own `/who` through a secure button, the approved way for addons, so it can't be used in combat). To keep you clear of spam detection, searches are limited to one every 15 seconds and 12 per 5 minutes; the button counts down until the next one is allowed. Everyone without a guild (who isn't already in yours) is added to the list. Players in a guild are never listed or messaged, here or from the /who window's whisper button. The game returns at most 50 players per search and limits how often you can search, so use narrow level ranges.
   - **Zone** starts as the zone you're in and **Level** as 3 levels below you to 2 above, and both follow you as you travel and level. Type your own to keep it; clear the box (both level boxes) to follow you again.
   - **Name:** type part of a character's name to show only matching players in the list right away; **Search** also looks for that name, so you can find a specific character. Clear it to see everyone again.
   - **Filter** opens a small menu: **Class**, **Step levels** (after each search the level range moves up by its own size, wrapping back to 1 at max level; keep clicking Search to sweep every level), and **Hide contacted**. **Reset filters** turns them all off. The Filter button shows how many are on, e.g. "Filter (2)".
   - The line under the search bar sums things up: players in the list, how many were new in the last search, how many you've whispered and how many replied, plus warnings (search capped at 50, Do Not Whisper players skipped). Active filters are listed on its right.
   - **Columns** work like the Roster tab's: drag a header sideways to move it, drag its edge to resize it, and right-click any header to show or hide columns (Lvl, Class, Zone, Status) or reset them, like the Find tab's. The tick box and Name always stay.
2. **Tick the players you want to message** (click the checkbox or anywhere on the row). **Select New** ticks every player nobody in the guild has contacted; **Clear** unticks all; **Clear New** (beside them) removes everyone you haven't contacted from the list. Hover a row to read the message that player will get.
3. Click **Send Whispers (N)**. Whispers go out one at a time, at least 12 seconds apart, and no more than your hourly cap (40 by default; 60, 90, 120 or no cap in **Options > Recruiting**). Blizzard doesn't publish a whisper limit: silences come from players reporting spam, so a friendly message matters more than the pace. The button shows the countdown and turns into **Stop** while sending. If the game ever refuses an automatic whisper, the addon switches to click-to-send for the rest of the session: the button becomes **Send Next** and each click sends one (same pacing). A `/reload` or your next login goes back to automatic; `/ngm diag` shows what the game blocked.
4. The Status column tracks each player: New, Queued, Whispered, Replied, Invited, and Joined! (detected automatically when they appear in your roster). Contacted players stay in the list so you never message anyone twice; **Clear New** removes only the uncontacted ones and **Hide contacted** (in Filter) hides the contacted ones.
   - **Statuses are shared with the guild.** When anyone running the addon whispers, hears back from, or invites a player, everyone else sees it ("Whispered 2 hr ago by Mira") and can't tick that player, so nobody is whispered twice by the same guild. Hover the row to read their reply.
   - **14-day lockout.** Once anyone in the guild whispers a player, **nobody in the guild (including you) can queue another recruitment whisper to them for 14 days**. The row can't be ticked and its tooltip says when they can be whispered again. Shared statuses are kept for those 14 days, then forgotten; your own list keeps your own history. The lockouts are sync records like everything else, so they're kept in your saved data through addon updates and every recruiter in the guild sees the same ones. The **Do Not Whisper** window lists everyone currently locked out, with the time left.
5. **Whisper from the game's /who window:** every player in the game's own /who search (the Looking For Group people search) gets a small letter button beside the group-invite button. One click sends that player your recruitment whisper, exactly as from the Recruitment tab: your custom messages when **Use custom messages** is on (otherwise the Default message), with the same spacing between whispers (it joins the whisper queue, which keeps sending while the window is closed). Hover the button to read the message they'll get. The player is added to your Recruitment list and their status is shared with the guild. The button is grayed out (hover it to see why) for anyone in a guild (yours or another), people on the Do Not Whisper list, and players anyone in your guild whispered in the last 14 days; it shows "..." while queued and a check once whispered. On by default; **Options > Recruiting** turns it off. If the buttons don't appear, search with the window open and run `/ngm diag`.
7. **Invites only after a whisper** (on the Recruitment tab). Right-click a player to invite them; the option stays unavailable ("whisper them first") until they've been whispered. Right-click also offers a one-off custom whisper and removing them.

**Default message** (right side): the whisper for anyone no custom message matches. These are filled in for you:

| Token | Becomes |
| --- | --- |
| `$first` | their first name (e.g. "Audrey"), what a person would type |
| `$name` | their full character name, first and second (e.g. "Audrey Pichhale") |
| `$class` | their class |
| `$level` | their level |
| `$race` | their race |
| `$zone` | the zone they're in |
| `$guild` | your guild's name in angle brackets, e.g. `<Knights of Azeroth>` |

A live preview shows the result. Whispers are limited to 255 characters (bytes: accented letters count twice). The counter shows the **longest** a message can get once filled in, using a 25-letter name (Forever allows 12 letters for each name) and your guild's name; it turns red when long names won't fit. When a whisper would be too long, it uses the player's first name only, and if it still doesn't fit it's cut at the last whole word, so it's never cut mid-word. The default message and the built-in class messages always fit.

**Custom messages**: tick **Use custom messages** and click **Custom Messages...** to open the editor. Each message has filters, and a player gets the first enabled message (top to bottom) whose filters all match them; anyone left over gets the Default message. Filters left empty match everyone:

- **Class** (any of the ticked classes) and **Race** (your faction's four races, each shown with its male and female portrait)
- **Level** range (1 to 60 unless you change it)
- **Zones**: comma-separated, matching any part of the zone name (`Elwynn, Westfall`)

Order is priority: use the up/down arrows to move a message. Put specific messages ("Night Elf Druids in Darkshore") above broad ones ("Druids"). **New**, **Copy** (duplicate and tweak) and **Delete** manage the list, and the enable box beside each message turns it off without deleting it. While you edit, the window shows how many players in the current search match the filters, how many will actually get this message (others may be taken by a message above it), and a preview for one of them. There's no gender filter: the game doesn't reliably say a player's gender.

**Built-in class messages**: a ready-made, friendly message for every class is added for you, written to read like a person typed it (their first name, "I'm recruiting for...", and a question like "Want an invite?" rather than a command word) (turned on, after any messages of your own). That includes Paladins and Shamans for both factions, since WoW: Forever lets either faction play them; guilds that set up their messages on older versions get the one they were missing (Paladin for Horde, Shaman for Alliance) added once, turned on. Edit them, switch them off or delete them; **Class Defaults** adds back any class that's missing one.

**Import / Export**: **Export...** shows every message as plain text to copy (Ctrl+C) and share on Discord, a website or a text file. **Import...** takes that text (Ctrl+V) and either adds the messages after yours or replaces your whole list. The format is easy to write by hand:

```
message: Night Elf Druids
on: yes
classes: Druid
races: Night Elf
levels: 10-60
zones: Teldrassil, Darkshore
text: Hey $first! I'm recruiting for $guild and we'd love a Druid from $zone. Want an invite?
```

Each message starts with `message:`. Lines you leave out mean "any"; `#` lines are ignored (older exports' `guild:` lines are accepted and ignored). Anything the importer can't read is reported, and the rest still imports.

**Auto-invite** (set up in **Options > Recruiting**): when a player you whispered from this tab replies with one of your up to 6 keywords, Nootropic Guild Manager pops up a **Guild Invite** prompt for them. Keywords match whole words in any case (`join` matches "Join pls" but not "joining"), and can be phrases like `sign me up`. Replies from anyone you didn't whisper here are ignored. WoW: Forever blocks every guild invite that comes from an addon: the invite function, `/ginvite` from a secure button, and `/ginvite` put in the chat box by the addon (opening the chat box taints it). Only `/ginvite` you type yourself works. So the prompt shows the command, `/ginvite First Last`: click **Copy Invite**, press **Ctrl+C**, then **Enter** (to open chat), **Ctrl+V**, **Enter**. The addon never touches your chat box. When the game confirms ("You have invited ... to join your guild"), the player is marked invited and the next waiting reply shows. Several replies queue up in the prompt ("2 more waiting"); **Not now** skips one. **Invite to Guild** on a player's right-click menu opens the same prompt. 

**Do Not Whisper list** (on by default, **shared with the guild**, set up in **Options > Recruiting**): when someone replies to the addon's whisper with one of up to 6 words or phrases (defaults: `dnw`, `leave me alone`, `do not whisper`, `stop whispering`, `not interested`, `no`; whole words, any case), they're added to the list. Only answers to the addon's whisper count: once you've whispered them yourself, or a day after the addon's whisper, their replies are just conversation and never add them. A reply with both a Do Not Whisper word and an invite keyword ("no guild yet, inv pls") doesn't add them either; you get the one-click Invite popup and decide. The list syncs to everyone in the guild running the addon, so once one recruiter is told to stop, nobody in the guild bothers that player again. People on it show "Do not whisper", can't be ticked, whispered or invited, and are skipped by future searches. Such a reply never auto-invites, so "yes, but leave me alone" doesn't get an invite. **View List** (or `/ngm dnw`) opens the **Do Not Whisper** window: everyone on the list for good (with when, by whom and what they said) and everyone whispered in the last 14 days (with the days left), searchable and filterable. Click a name to take them off the list, or to put a recently whispered player on it for good. Entries on the list never expire, whether added by a reply or by hand. To add someone by hand, right-click their name **in chat** (whispers included), on your target, party or raid frames, or on the Recruitment tab, and pick **Add to Do Not Whisper**. Additions and removals appear in the Audit tab. Unticking the box stops adding people; anyone already listed stays protected.

Messages and keywords are saved per guild.

**Audit tab** (officers only) — every synced change across the guild: when, who changed it, which character, and what changed (e.g. "Joined the guild (invited by Mira)", "Promoted to Officer (was Veteran)", "Marked as an alt of Markpri", "Discord changed"). It also logs changes to the guild itself: **joins and rejoins** (with who invited), **leaves**, **kicks**, **promotions and demotions** (with who did them, read from the game's guild event log), plus **level-ups**, **public and officer note changes** and **name changes** (noticed in the roster; shown as changed by "Guild roster"). Every officer running the addon sees the same changes, and their copies merge into one line. Search it, filter by kind of change (joined / left, promotions / demotions, level ups, guild notes, name changes, main/alt, spec, roles, professions, contact, officer log, permissions, Do Not Whisper) or by character, and click a row to open that profile. Changes saved together (within one 15-second batch, see below) are grouped into one line; hover it to see each change, or untick **Group changes**. How long history is kept is set in Options.

## Who can do what

| | Everyone with the addon | Officers |
| --- | --- | --- |
| See roster, mains/alts, specs, professions, contact info | yes | yes |
| Add someone to the Do Not Whisper list | yes | yes |
| Edit their **own** spec, roles, professions and contact info | yes (by default) | yes |
| Recruit; take someone off the Do Not Whisper list | | yes (by default) |
| Link mains and alts | | yes (by default) |
| Edit others' spec, roles, professions and contact info | | yes (by default) |
| Officer Log, Change History, Audit tab | | yes |

"Officers" are ranks that can read officer notes (the game's own permission). If someone is promoted or demoted, the addon updates on the spot.

**Permissions** (Guild Master only, in **Options > Officers > Permissions**): every row marked "by default" can be given to other ranks or taken away: **edit their own profile** (everyone by default; spec, roles, professions and contact info, not what their addon reports by itself), **link mains and alts**, **recruit** (officers by default), and **edit other guildmates' profiles** (spec, roles, professions, contact; this includes their own). Pick ranks from each row's menu, or the default to go back. Untick everyone and only the Guild Master can. The Guild Master always can. Officer Log and Audit always stay with officers: the game only delivers that data to officer ranks. Permission changes show in the Audit tab.

## Options

Open from **Options > AddOns > Nootropic Guild Manager**, `/ngm options`, right-clicking the minimap button (by default), or right-clicking the addon compartment entry.

Options has four pages in the game's AddOns list:

- **Nootropic Guild Manager** (main page)
  - **Appearance**: the **addon icon** (the **Nootropic Medallion** by default, or the game's Ale Mug or Brewfest Stein icons, or your **Guild Emblem**; shown on the window, the minimap button and the Guild & Communities shortcut; the emblem falls back to the medallion outside a guild or without a tabard), **use my guild's name in the window title** (also in the "x using ... Guild Manager" text), **show how many guildmates use the addon** (on by default), the **shortcut on the Guild & Communities window**, and **Show alts and profiles on the Guild roster** (on by default).
  - **Sharing** (what your copy shares with the guild; all on by default): **Share my spec and professions**, **Share my recipes**, **Learn when I usually play** (this character), **Show me in Play Together** and **Share my statistics** (Hall of Fame). Turning one off stops sharing it and clears what was already shared. A **Show the Welcome Tour** button reopens the walkthrough.
  - **Minimap Button**: show/hide it (also `/ngm minimap`), and choose what left-click, right-click and shift-click do (Find, Play Together, Recruitment, Audit, Options, show/hide window, or nothing). Drag the button to move it around the edge of the minimap; the spot is saved. The game's own AddOns menu button on the minimap (where this addon is also listed) is Blizzard's and can't be moved.
  - **Reset**: window size and position, and list columns (roster and recruitment list).
  - **Sync and Commands**: sync stats with a **Sync Now** button, **Open Guild Manager**, and the most useful commands.
- **Recruiting** (saved per guild, except the hourly cap): the **recruitment whisper button on /who results** (on by default), **Whispers per hour** (40 by default, for all your characters), **Auto-Invite** (Invite popup on a keyword reply, up to 6 keywords) and **Do Not Whisper** (on/off, up to 6 words, and the shared list). The Recruitment tab shows how these are set under **Replies**, with a **Reply Settings...** button that opens this page.
- **Officers**: **Permissions** (Guild Master, whole guild) and **Audit History** (keep 30, 60 or 90 days on your copy). Members see this page but can't change it.
- **About**: what the addon does, credits, and links to copy (the game can't open web pages): the maintainer's site, the **Nootropic Discord** and the addon's GitHub page.

The window's tabs run down its right side like the character panel's; hover one for its name. Tabs you can't use (Recruitment without the recruit permission, Audit for non-officers) are hidden.

## Searching

Type any words. A member is shown when every word matches their name, class, spec or professions.

| Query | Finds |
| --- | --- |
| `warrior protection` | protection warriors |
| `tailoring enchanting` | members with both professions |
| `zone:"elwynn forest"` | quotes keep a phrase together |
| `prof:herb` `spec:holy` `class:mage` `name:ann` | one field only |
| `rank:officer` `zone:stormwind` `note:healer` | rank, zone, notes |
| `discord:mira` | Discord name or contact note |
| `level>=55` | level filter |
| `main:markpri` | Markpri and all their alts |
| `is:alt` / `is:main` | only alts / only mains |
| `is:addon` | only guildmates running Nootropic Guild Manager |
| `is:missing` | only guildmates without it |
| `-alchemy` | exclude a match |

`/ngm find <text>` opens the roster with a search already typed.

## Where professions and specs come from

The game does not let addons read another player's professions or talents. Nootropic Guild Manager handles this two ways:

- **Members running Nootropic Guild Manager** share their own professions and spec automatically over the hidden guild addon channel when they log in, when they change talents or skills, and when someone opens the roster, and every few minutes (or right away with **Sync Now** in Options or `/ngm sync`). A green check marks synced data.
- **Everyone else** can be filled in by hand from the detail panel. Synced data takes priority for professions; a manual spec always wins over a synced one.

Spec is detected from the modern specialization API when the client has it, otherwise from whichever talent tree has the most points (shown as a split like `5/31/15`).

## Mains and alts rules

- Links always point at the top-level main. Marking a character as an alt of someone's alt links it to that main instead.
- Marking a main (who has alts) as an alt moves their whole family to the new main.
- **Make This Main** swaps roles when a player changes which character they main.

## How syncing works

Every shared value (a member's main, spec, professions, contact info, an officer log entry, a permission) is stored with the time it was changed and who changed it. The newest change always wins, so everyone ends up with the same data no matter the order messages arrive in.

- **Batches:** your changes show up for you instantly but are sent 15 seconds after the first one, all together. Everything in one batch is grouped in the audit.
- **Repair:** every few minutes, and whenever you open the window, each copy of the addon sends a short checksum of its data. If a guildmate's checksums differ, the records that differ are re-sent on the same channel, and other clients skip re-sending what someone just sent. Missed messages, officers who were offline, and new installs all catch up this way, with no "Sync" button needed. Nothing is ever whispered.
- **Officer-only data** (officer log, audit) only ever travels on the game's officer addon channel, which the game delivers only to officer ranks.
- **Pacing:** messages are rate-limited to stay well under the game's limits; if the game reports throttling, messages are retried rather than lost.

In testing, three simulated clients (two officers and a member) with 40-50% of messages randomly dropped, one officer offline while others made changes, and conflicting edits all ended up identical.

`/ngm sync` runs a sync immediately and shows counts of messages sent, received and applied.

- **Who can change what is checked by everyone.** Every copy of the addon checks each incoming record against the guild roster: the sender must be allowed to write it (their own profile; for anything else, a rank the Guild Master's permissions allow, or an officer). Records someone else wrote are only accepted when an officer passes them on (only officer ranks can send on the officer channel, so this can't be faked), and permission settings only when the current Guild Master made them. So a guildmate can't forge someone's profile, links or the Guild Master's permissions by sending hand-made addon messages.

## Your data

Everything is saved per guild in `WTF/Account/<account>/SavedVariables/NootropicGuildManager.lua`, along with your settings. **Private notes never leave your computer**; shared data syncs as described above.

What is shared:
- With everyone running the addon (each part can be switched off in **Options > Sharing**, except the basics like your version): each player's own professions and spec, mains/alts, spec/profession overrides, contact info (Discord name and note), roles, when each person usually plays (only the learned summary), the recipes they know, their raid readiness, the Do Not Whisper list, recruitment statuses (the last 14 days), which addon version each person runs, and the Guild Master's permissions.
- With officers only: Officer Log entries (140 characters max; deleting one deletes it for every officer) and the audit trail.

Each of 1.x, 2.0 and 2.1 uses its own sync protocol, so guildmates on different ones don't exchange data at all; everyone should run the latest release. When you first load 2.0, data from removed features (reviews, ratings, map dots, polls, stats, goals, kudos, About me, status, pronouns, tab settings) is deleted from your saved data. Loading 2.1 does the same for tags, tag assignments, tag icons and the tag permissions.

A note on trust: every copy of the addon checks each change it receives against the guild roster: the sender must be allowed to make it, only officers can pass on other people's changes, and permission settings only count from the Guild Master. Officer data only travels on the officer channel. Every change is also recorded in the Audit tab with its author.

The [architecture guide](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) covers the sync protocol, every shared record and who may write it, the security checks, and WoW: Forever's restrictions.

## Names in WoW: Forever

Forever characters have a first and second name (e.g. "Audrey Pichhale") and no realms. The addon whispers and invites by the plain name, never "Name-Realm", and shows the two names in separate roster columns. The game quietly tags each name with the server shard that player lives on, so the addon ignores those tags and knows everyone by their plain name (before 2.7.2, guildmates on different shards didn't see each other's data).
